# Open Source Brawl Server

BrawlStars is an open-source server project written in C# using .NET 7.0! This server is designed to provide a core infrastructure for handling packet receiving and sending for supercell games. While this open-source version includes the fundamental components, we plan to extend and enhance its functionality in the future.

## Features

- **C# & .NET 7.0**: This project is built using C# and leverages the features of .NET 7.0 to provide a modern and efficient server infrastructure.

- **Dependency Injection**: We use the .NET Dependency Injection system to manage and inject the necessary components and services, making the codebase modular and maintainable.

- **Async Operators**: Asynchronous programming is at the core of this server, allowing it to handle multiple concurrent connections efficiently.

- **High-Performance Memory Management**: We prioritize memory efficiency to ensure that the server can handle a large number of players and connections without excessive resource consumption.

## Usage

The server is designed as a core framework for supercell games. You can extend and customize it to fit your specific game requirements. The server handles packet receiving and sending but doesn't include game-specific logic, so you will need to implement that separately.

Here are some key components and how to use them:

- **Packet Handling**: Implement packet handling logic in the appropriate classes and methods. You can use the provided packet handling structure as a starting point.

- **Dependency Injection**: Configure the dependency injection container to provide the necessary services and components for your game logic. The server uses Dependency Injection to manage services and components effectively.

- **Memory Management**: The server is designed with memory efficiency in mind. Optimize and monitor memory usage to ensure the server can handle a large number of connections without resource issues.
